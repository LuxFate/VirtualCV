Portfolio website CV

For the front page of my website i decided to have header with my name and buttons to direct people to different parts of my website. In the front page i googled different animation you can do i html and css and found the idea to have the front page headline being highlighted by using key frames to increment the words being highlighted and used a data-text for the highlighted word. I used a query selector to handle the scrolling and click events.

For the about me page i used buttons to link my github and linkedin account and formated different sections about myself(still working on what else to write in the about me page). i tried to use different font style for each part 

For the projects section i inputed img and description with repo and demo buttons that will redirect the user to the github and demo if the game. I decided to label each project and input a pic with a desc(still working on) to explain what each project is.
